## 1. Organization
Every major commit should be dressing one of the current open issues (located in GitHub tab above). The issues are the main way of organizing and prioritizing work. If you plan to contribute please familiarize or add to those various issues.

## 2. Authorization
Note that to test locally you will need the unencrypted version of the `ucf-trading-ed09408582af.json` service file. However to test just push to GitHub and Travis will take care of the rest.
The only other credentials you will need are `Robinhood_Login` and `Robinhood_Pass`
